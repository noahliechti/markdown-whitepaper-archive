## Why should I use this archive?

- Open-source projects evolve and so do whitepapers. We update the whitepapers as soon as there is a new version
- Usually whitepapers are published in PDF format. Markdown makes it easy to [embed and display](https://github.com/noahliechti/markdown-whitepaper-archive/fork) them in your own projects and format them how you like.
- There is no need to spend time searching for whitepapers. We curate all of them in one place
